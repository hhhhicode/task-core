# CLAUDE.md Created

A comprehensive CLAUDE.md file has been created at the project root with the following key sections:

## Contents

1. **Project Overview**: Spring Boot 3.5.6 reactive backend with Kotlin, WebFlux, R2DBC, and JOOQ
2. **Development Commands**: Build, run, test commands with specific examples
3. **Architecture & Patterns**: 
   - Reactive programming model (non-blocking)
   - Dual database driver setup (R2DBC + JDBC for Liquibase)
   - JOOQ integration patterns
   - Testing conventions
4. **Key Constraints**: Critical architectural constraints and patterns

## Key Architectural Decisions Documented

- Fully reactive, non-blocking architecture
- R2DBC for reactive database access
- Liquibase migrations run on startup
- Kotlin coroutines with Reactor integration
- Type-safe queries with JOOQ

This file will help future Claude Code instances understand the project's architecture and development workflows quickly.
